#Simple Android Application
Working on some touchpoints to get myself familiar with the Android ecosystem. Since I don't have any million dollar ideas for an application yet, I thought I'd start with some basic functions using the Github APIs.

Disclaimer: As of the creation of this application, I have never used or seen the actual Github Android application. This project is for educational purposes only.
